# QuerryStack using JavaScript

## Abstract
#### Here we are using javascript to fetch the data that has been passed by SignUp form from URL and then take the input in the login form and match the credentials if valid then only user can login otherwise an error will be raised. 

## Languages Used
#### 1. HTML ( DOCUMENT / Structure)
#### 2. Internal CSS ( Styling )
#### 3. Java Script ( Validation and Fetching querry )

## Retriving the data from URL Querry String
#### As the user is filling the signup form and submitiing it then he will be refirected to the Loginpage where the user will enter user id or emailid and password that will be checked from the past signup page details and that details will be retrived from URL. After if user is authenticated they will move to next page and acknowledgement will be apeard with user id and password.

## I am using URLSearchParams(location.search) method
#### In this method location.search is helping me to retriev the string from the URL and then URLSearchParams is helping me to retrive the parameters from that string and then I am storing it in a variable with constant extension so that it should not be changed and do the desired operation.
